# qShop

Welcome to my quantum workshop! This is a place for me to organize code and calculations related to quantum information processing.
Everything is a work in progress.

As of today (2025-09-17) I have roughtly sorted the tools into:
i. Quantum circuits, which rely on the stim package, but also some beginnings of constructions using the qulacs package.
ii. Quantum codes and the CSS code class, originally put together to explore connections between quantum codes and point-set topology.
iii. Quantum architectures, still early, but the idea is to use a graph to represent the connectivity constraints of qubit devices.
iv. Demonstrations, collected in the folder 'demo', these are likely to be jupyter notebooks demonstrating a particular calculation or features of the code.
